            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>A garage box in The Hague is the place where the adventure started in 2008, with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and
                Pascal Rapailles. The garage quickly became too small while they moved to a shed on one
                industrial area.
                Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be diverted to one in the middle of winter
                vacant Ministry of Agriculture.
                When this building also had to be cleared out, the current collection of 10 arcade video games was met
                some spare parts stored in an old classic car showroom.
                Because there was no room to renovate or play with the cabinets, they looked for a suitable solution
                room.
                It was found in 2011 on the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer. Among them, Hasan fell to 4 friends
                to rent a location and the adventure could grow into their own meeting place to practice their hobby.

                <h2>Reviews</h2>
                <p>The game hall is set up very nice. Certainly the history of
                    gaming to today's arcade experience. You get the feeling that you are in
                     japan is because of the type of games and of course also arcade what directly
                      Japan has been imported (so no translation to English). The only flaw
                       is, which I find a bit worse, that most arcade it
                       didn't act or a gun is missing, which makes playing together impossible.
                       Certainly 4/10 arcade are the second player “out of order”. Like the gaming computers
                        If everything is well maintained then it was definitely worth a 9 to a 10 for me. Now I give it a 7.
                        </p>
